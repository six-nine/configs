# My dotfiles

iterm, nvim, tmux and zsh configs

## iTerm2
Open iTerm2, go to 'iTerm2 > Preferences', and under the 'General' tab, check the box labeled ‘Load preferences from a custom folder or URL’. Point it to the com.googlecode.iterm2.plist file.

## zsh
Note: I have workstation-specific lines in zshrc, and my config loads these configs from file named `.zshaddons` located at home directory.
